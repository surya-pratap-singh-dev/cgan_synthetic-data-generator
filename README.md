## 📌 What This Does

This project **generates realistic synthetic financial transaction data** using a Conditional GAN (CGAN). 

**Why this matters:**
- Banks and fintech companies need fraud detection training data
- Real financial data is private and hard to access
- Synthetic data solves this: realistic enough to train ML models, but completely fake
- No privacy issues, no compliance headaches

**In 30 seconds:** Upload a small dataset → Model learns fraud patterns → Generates thousands of realistic fake transactions → Use for training fraud detectors

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Fully Trained CGAN Model** - Pre-trained on IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset
- ✅ **Interactive Streamlit Interface** - Generate synthetic transactions with one click
- ✅ **Real Fraud Patterns** - Learns and replicates actual fraud behavior
- ✅ **Privacy-Safe** - Zero real customer data exposed
- ✅ **Production Ready** - Model weights included, deployable anywhere

---

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing** - Real fraud transactions are cleaned, normalized, and prepared
2. **CGAN Training** - Generator learns to create fake transactions that mimic real fraud patterns
3. **Synthetic Data Generation** - Model outputs realistic transaction data with proper fraud distribution
4. **Quality Validation** - Generated data is evaluated against real data characteristics

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the Live Demo (Easiest)
Just visit the **[Streamlit link above](https://cgansynthetic-data-generator-6byxvzuiph4ewfvodtc92i.streamlit.app/)** and start generating data.

### Option 2: Run Locally

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/FAKE-SURYA/cgan_synthetic-data-generator.git
cd cgan_synthetic-data-generator

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

## 📈 Results

The trained model successfully:
- ✅ Generates 1000+ synthetic transactions in seconds
- ✅ Maintains realistic fraud-to-legitimate ratio (~3% fraud)
- ✅ Captures feature distributions of real data
- ✅ Produces valid transactions ready for ML training

**Example Output:**
- Input: 100 real transactions
- Output: 10,000 synthetic transactions with identical statistical properties
